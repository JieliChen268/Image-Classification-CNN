# Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification

For Project 2 of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree, I built a Convolutional Neural Network (i.e. CNN or ConvNet) for Image Classification. 
The images are from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Some of the steps I took included: normalization, one-hot encoding, building convolutional layers, maxpooling, ReLu activation. 
The code is written in Python (v3) and is presented via Jupyter Notebook. I trained the network using an AWS EC2 instance with an Anaconda environment.
